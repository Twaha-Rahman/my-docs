Things I want to cover:

echo, ls, cd, pwd, touch, cp, rm, mv, pattern expansion (\* and ~), vim basics
(How to write a line in it and how to quit it with or without saving), cat, wc,
grep (Just the absolute basic stuff; no regex), talk about the Unix philosophy
(everything in Unix is a file), talk about command arguments and flags/options,
piping (|), redirection (>), append (>>)
