# General ToDo

- Common unpacking/decompression and vice-versa using the terminal:
    - zip
    - tar
    - etc...

- Do a deep dive into the following topics:
    - PNG
    - PDF

- Look into cryptography and hash related things neeeded for cyber security
(the basics for now)
    - Plaintext/Ciphertext
    - Symmetric Encryption (Single key): AES, DES
    - Asymmetric Encryption (Public and private key): RSA, ECC
    - Hashing: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2,...
    - Digital Signature: RSA, DSA
    - Certificate Authorities (CAs): Binds a public key with an identity. (Use
    in things like HTPS)
    - SSL/TLS protocol: Secure communication over a network The presence of
    `https://` means that SSL/TLS is being used. 
    - PKI (Public Key Infracstructure): PKI is a comprehensive system that
    manages the creation, distribution, storage, retification of digital
    certificates. 

- Commonly used port numbers and what they are used for
    - For example, port 22 is used for SSH
