# Permissions in Linux

This doc will go over the things that I found interesting from the Arch Wiki's page on *Users and Groups*.

# Permissions and Ownership

To view the permissions of a file/directory, run the `ls -l` command like so:

```sh
ls -l /boot
```

That should give you the following output:

```sh
total 231708
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     81920 Mar 13 17:34 amd-ucode.img
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root      4096 Jan 30 02:57 EFI
drwxr-xr-x 6 root root      4096 Apr  1 10:35 grub
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 126657583 Mar 30 08:12 initramfs-linux-fallback.img
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  97593010 Mar 30 08:12 initramfs-linux.img
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  12919296 Mar 30 08:12 vmlinuz-linux
```

There are 9 columns in total.

The first character in the first column tells us what type of file it is:

`-` -> File
`d` -> Directory
`l` -> Symbolic link (symlink)
`c` -> Character file

Then, every 3 characters after that tells us the permissions
of the user, user group, and others have over that file respectively.

For the **EFI** directory:

`rwx` -> User has Read, Write, and Execute permissions
`r-x` -> User group has Read and Execute permissions
`r-x` -> Others has Read and Execute permissions

The second column shows the number of hard-links the file has.

The third and fourth column shows the name of the user and the user group respectively.

The fifth column shows the file size.

The sixth, seventh and eighth shows the date and time of the file created/last modified.

The last column shows the name of the particular file/directory.

## Using `stat` to find the owner of a file

It's possible to see a file/directory's owner user, group or even it's access rights using `stat` like so:

```sh
$ stat -c %U /boot
root

$ stat -c %G /boot
root

$ stat -c %A /boot
drwxr-xr-x
```

## Using `find` to find files owned by a user/group

It's possible to find files owned by a specific user/group by using the following command:

```sh
# find /boot -group root
# find /usr -user twaha
```

## Changing ownership or access permissions of a file

`chown` -> Changes owner of file
`chmod` -> Changes access permissions of file

# User Management

To list all existing user accounts including their properties, run `sudo passwd -Sa`. The output will be:

```sh
root P 2024-01-30 -1 -1 -1 -1
bin L 2024-01-29 -1 -1 -1 -1
daemon L 2024-01-29 -1 -1 -1 -1
mail L 2024-01-29 -1 -1 -1 -1
ftp L 2024-01-29 -1 -1 -1 -1
http L 2024-01-29 -1 -1 -1 -1
nobody L 2024-01-29 -1 -1 -1 -1
dbus L 2024-01-29 -1 -1 -1 -1

twaha P 2024-01-30 0 99999 7 -1
avahi L 2024-01-30 -1 -1 -1 -1
cups L 2024-01-30 -1 -1 -1 -1

rtkit L 2024-01-30 -1 -1 -1 -1
flatpak L 2024-01-31 -1 -1 -1 -1
```
The output consists of seven columns.

Each of the columns represent username, \*password status, last password change date, minimum age, maximum age, warning period,
and inactivity period. (The ages are represented in days) 

*\*password status:*

L -> Locked Password
NP -> No Password
P -> (Usable) Password

To view only the details of a specific user, run the command as that user:

```sh
❯ sudo passwd -S
root P 2024-01-30 -1 -1 -1 -1

❯ passwd -S
twaha P 2024-01-30 0 99999 7 -1
```

## Add new user

Use `useradd` to add users, run these two commands:

```sh
# useradd -m -G <group1,group2> -s <login_shell> brad
# passwd brad
```

The `-m` flag creates the new user's home directory as `/home/<username>` (for the above example, it'll
be `/home/brad`). The `-G` adds the user to the groups specified (comma separated groups). The `-s` flag
sets the shell binary for the new user's shell. *All of these flags are optional*

Setting the new user's password can be done using the `passwd <username>` command. (This step is optional)

## Change user's login name or home directory

To change a user's home directory, run:

```sh
# usermod -d /my/new/home -m <username>
```

The `-m` option automatically creates the new directory and moves the content there.

**Tip: You can create a link form the user's former home directory to the new one. Doing so will allow programs
to find files that have hardcoded paths. To do so, run the following command: **

```sh
# ls -s /my/new/home /my/old/home
```

To change a user's login name, first make sure that you're not loged in as that user. Log in as `root` in TTY
for example. Then run from the TTY:

```sh
# usermod -l <newname> <oldname>
```
